# What is Vector76 Attack?

Roughly speaking, it is an attack method that takes advantage of blockchain issues and allows double payments by pretending that transactions with a small number of approvals (up to 1 or 2 Confirmations?) have not occurred.
Retail stores, mail order stores, etc. are affected.

The objectives of this project are:

- There are several demo videos of tools that attack Bitcoin on YouTube and elsewhere, and most of them seem to be paid and are trying to scam large sums of money. Therefore, the purpose is to destroy Bitcoin crack tool (sales) scammers. (Fraud Breaker)
 (Fraud Breaker) **If you really can do that, I'd like you to openly show me the source code.**
- To destroy a gambling site (bookmaker) with a fragile payment system (Boss Breaker)
- For educational purposes.

# How to use a this tool, Things necessary

**This is just a tool to make double payments. Therefore, the attacker needs to prepare Bitcoin.**

```
usage: vector76.py [-h]
                   node_host node_port username password prev_deposit_TXID attacker_signkey victim_address attacker_address amount_of_coins
                   prev_deposit_TXID

How To Use vector76

positional arguments:
  node_host          Blockchain Node Host
  node_port          Blockchain Node Port
  username           Node username
  password           Node password
  prev_deposit_TXID  Last deposit TXID of first attacker address
  attacker_signkey   The attacker has the WIF format private key of the first address (this is used to sign the transaction)
  victim_address     victim address.
  attacker_address   Address held by attacker to receive refund (Please prepare an address that is different from the address that can be generated with the
                     private key specified in the first place.)
  amount_of_coins    Amount of coins sent. (Enter in BTC units)
  prev_deposit_TXID  Last deposit TXID of first attacker address

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
```

During the attack,
```--- Send the block after pressing the enter key. ---```
What to do when this appears is
Immediately after the money is sent to the victim's wallet address, 1 approval has passed, and the payment at the store etc. is completed.
Press enter. Then a block is sent and a Vector76 attack is performed. So please keep your eyes on the screen during this time.

# Disclaimer

If you run this tool on mainnet, you do so at your own risk.

Also, since I am incompetent, I made this using these documents as reference. The operation is not yet confirmed as it takes time to synchronize the nodes.

If you are trying to destroy the mainnet and use this tool, you will not know if your assets disappear due to a bug, exchange or wallet account being frozen, etc.
suffering the consequences. :D

Happy Hacking!
